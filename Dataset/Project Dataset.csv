WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva insisting that the issue is seriousAn outbreak of both bubonic plague which is spread by infected rats via flea bites and pneumonic plague spread person to person has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since AugustMadagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980 often caused by rats fleeing forest firesThe disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season from September to AprilOn average between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people according to a UN estimateBut Tedros voiced alarm that plague in Madagascar behaved in,no_propaganda

the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia ZarateAs a result of the case both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policiesThe DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custodySan Francisco meanwhile has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies,no_propaganda
ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement on ThursdayIt is unconscionable that,no_propaganda
But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Franciscos custodyThe agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courtsThough the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally bindingSan Franciscos policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judgesigned warrants and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates Fourth Amendment rightsGarcia Zarates deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners who argued that,no_propaganda
President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of Illegal ImmigrationTrump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinles death during his presidential campaign using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against sanctuary citiesEarly on Friday Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration,no_propaganda
